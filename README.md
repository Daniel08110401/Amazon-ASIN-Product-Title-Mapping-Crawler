# Amazon-ASIN-Product-Title-Mapping-Crawler

This project automates the process of mapping Amazon ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) codes to product titles using a hybrid web scraping pipeline.

It leverages **Google Search**, **ScrapeOps Proxy**, and **Amazon product pages** to reliably extract product titles associated with each ASIN, with robust fallback handling for redirection, CAPTCHA, and request failures.
